## About the Project
Pragati 2025 is a prestigious event organized by MBA students, aiming to bring together industry experts, students, and enthusiasts for a series of insightful sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities. The backend code for Pragati 2025 has been meticulously developed to ensure seamless operation, robust security, and efficient data handling.

## Features
### https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0
https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0 is used as the web application framework for building APIs, handling routes, and managing server-side logic efficiently. The lightweight and minimalistic nature of https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0 makes it an ideal choice for developing the backend of Pragati 2025.

### JWT Token Authentication
JWT tokens are implemented for secure user authentication and authorization. By issuing JWT tokens upon successful login, the backend ensures that only authenticated users can access restricted resources within the application.

### Middleware
Middleware functions are used in the backend to execute code, handle requests, and enhance the functionality of the server. Various middleware modules are integrated to perform tasks such as logging, error handling, and parsing incoming data.

### MySQL Database Integration
The MySQL database is employed to store and manage data related to users, events, registrations, and other essential information for the Pragati 2025 platform. The backend interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve and update data as required.

### https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0 Environment
https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0 provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. The asynchronous, event-driven architecture of https://github.com/attorneywenn/Pragati_Backend_2025/releases/tag/v2.0 contributes to the high performance and scalability of the Pragati 2025 backend.

### PASETO Version 4
PASETO (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens) version 4 is utilized for generating secure tokens that can be safely transmitted over the network. PASETO tokens offer robust security features and help in preventing token-based attacks.

### PayU Integration
The PayU payment gateway is integrated into the backend to facilitate secure online payments for event registrations, merchandise purchases, and other transactions within the Pragati 2025 platform. Payment processing is handled seamlessly through the PayU API.

### RESTful API Design
The backend follows RESTful principles to design a well-structured API that supports standard HTTP methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. The REST architecture ensures interoperability and scalability of the Pragati 2025 API.

### RSA Encryption
RSA encryption is applied to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data exchanged between the client and server. By encrypting data using the RSA algorithm, the backend enhances data security and protects against unauthorized access.

### Swagger Documentation
Swagger documentation is generated to provide detailed information about the API endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements. The Swagger UI enables developers to interact with the API and understand its functionality effortlessly.

## Future Enhancements
The Pragati 2025 backend code is continuously evolving to incorporate new features, enhance performance, and address emerging requirements. Some of the planned enhancements for the future include:
- Implementing real-time notifications using WebSockets
- Enhancing data validation and error handling mechanisms
- Integrating caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Adding support for multi-factor authentication
- Expanding API capabilities for advanced event management
